# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple webpage that mimics an etch-a-sketch using a starting 16x16 grid of squares.
At any moment while webpage is selected you can press the "n" key to reset the grid and enter your new desired dimension (1 to 100 inclusive).
Pressing the "r" will turn the plots red, "g" will turn them green and "b" turns them blue. (press a R G or B key twice to return to black)
You can also decide if you want to use opacity by pressing the "o" key. When option is selected you must pass over the grid plot 10 times for it to be fully colored.

To run just simply download all files and open the index.html file and have fun! :D
