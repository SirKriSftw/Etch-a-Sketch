# Etch-a-Sketch

A simple webpage that mimics an etch-a-sketch using a starting 16x16 grid of squares.
At any moment while webpage is selected you can press the "r" key to reset the grid and enter your new desired dimension (1 to 100 inclusive).

To run just simply download all files and open the index.html file and have fun! :D
